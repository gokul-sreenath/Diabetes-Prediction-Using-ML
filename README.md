# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML
Predicting whether a person is diabetic or not using a machine learning model

## About
The Diabetes Prediction Web App is designed to estimate the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various diagnostic measurements. This application is specifically intended for females over 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage, utilizing data from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Its purpose is to predict the presence of diabetes in patients based on various diagnostic measurements. The selection of instances from a larger database is subject to several constraints: all patients are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. This dataset, available on Kaggle, includes the following health criteria:

* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration measured two hours after an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
* Age: Age in years
* Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
### Dataset Details:
* Number of Instances: 768
* Number of Attributes: 8 plus class
* Missing Attribute Values: Yes
* Class Distribution: Class value 1 indicates a positive test for diabetes
